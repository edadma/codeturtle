## A

**Angle**
: A measurement of rotation in degrees. A full circle is 360°.

**Arc**
: A curved line forming part of a circle.

## B

**Base case**
: The condition that stops a recursive procedure from calling itself forever.

## C

**Command**
: An instruction that tells the turtle what to do, like `forward` or `right`.

**Coordinate**
: A pair of numbers (x, y) that specify a position on the screen. The center is (0, 0).

## D

**Degrees**
: The unit for measuring angles. 90° is a quarter turn, 180° is a half turn, 360° is a full turn.

## E

**Exterior angle**
: The angle the turtle turns at each corner of a polygon. For a regular polygon: 360° ÷ number of sides.

## F

**Fractal**
: A pattern that contains smaller copies of itself at every scale.

## H

**Home**
: The center of the screen, position (0, 0), where the turtle starts.

## I

**Input**
: A value passed to a procedure. Also called a parameter. Written with a colon like `:size`.

**Interior angle**
: The angle inside a polygon at each corner. For a regular polygon: 180° - exterior angle.

## L

**Logo**
: A programming language created in 1967, famous for turtle graphics.

**Loop**
: Code that repeats. In Logo, use `repeat` to create loops.

## P

**Parameter**
: See Input.

**Pen**
: The turtle's drawing tool. When "down" it draws, when "up" it doesn't.

**Pixel**
: A single dot on the screen. Turtle steps are measured in pixels.

**Polygon**
: A closed shape with straight sides. Regular polygons have equal sides and angles.

**Procedure**
: A named set of commands you can reuse. Defined with `to` and `end`.

## R

**Recursion**
: When a procedure calls itself. Used to create fractals and complex patterns.

**Regular polygon**
: A polygon where all sides are equal length and all angles are equal.

**RGB**
: Red, Green, Blue - a way to specify colors using three numbers from 0-255.

## S

**Steps**
: The unit of distance for turtle movement. One step equals one pixel.

## T

**Turtle**
: The arrow-shaped cursor that draws on screen. It moves forward/back and turns left/right.

**Turtle graphics**
: A way of creating drawings by controlling a virtual turtle with commands.

## V

**Variable**
: A named container that stores a value. Created with `make`, accessed with `:name`.
