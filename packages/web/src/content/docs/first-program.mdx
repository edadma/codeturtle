## Drawing a Line

Let's start simple. Type this command:

```logo
forward 100
```

The turtle moves forward 100 steps, drawing a line behind it. Congratulations - you just wrote code!

## Making a Turn

Now let's turn the turtle:

```logo
right 90
```

The turtle rotates 90 degrees to the right (clockwise). It doesn't move, just changes direction.

## Drawing a Square

A square has 4 sides and 4 corners. Each corner is a 90-degree turn. Here's how to draw one:

```logo
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90
```

You just drew a square! The turtle moved forward, turned, moved forward, turned... four times total.

## Making it Cleaner

That was a lot of typing. Notice we repeated the same two commands 4 times? In the next lessons, you'll learn how to use `repeat` to simplify this:

```logo
repeat 4 [forward 100 right 90]
```

One line instead of eight! That's the power of programming.

## Try These Challenges

1. **Draw a bigger square** - Change `100` to `200`
2. **Draw a rectangle** - Use different lengths for width and height
3. **Draw a triangle** - Hint: use `120` degrees for turns

## What's Next?

Now that you can move and turn the turtle, let's explore:

- [Moving the Turtle](/basics/movement/) - More about `forward` and `back`
- [Turning](/basics/turning/) - Angles and direction
- [Repeat Loops](/concepts/repeat/) - Stop repeating yourself!
