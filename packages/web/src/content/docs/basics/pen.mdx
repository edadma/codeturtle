## Pen Up and Pen Down

The turtle carries a pen. When the pen is **down**, it draws. When it's **up**, it moves without drawing.

```logo
penup          ; Lift the pen (stop drawing)
pu             ; Short form

pendown        ; Lower the pen (start drawing)
pd             ; Short form
```

## Moving Without Drawing

Use `penup` to reposition the turtle:

```logo
; Draw a square
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90

; Move to a new position without drawing
penup
forward 150
pendown

; Draw another square
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
```

## Drawing Dashed Lines

Alternate between pen up and pen down:

```logo
repeat 10 [
  pendown
  forward 10
  penup
  forward 10
]
```

## Pen State

You can check or reset the pen:

```logo
home           ; Return turtle to center, facing up
clean          ; Erase all drawings (turtle stays)
clearscreen    ; Erase all and reset turtle (or cs)
```

## Try It

1. Draw two squares side by side (use `penup` to move between them)
2. Create a dashed circle using pen up/down with small movements
3. Draw your initials using lines and `penup` to move between letters
