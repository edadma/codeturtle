description: Learn the forward and back commands

## Forward Movement

The `forward` command (or `fd` for short) moves the turtle in the direction it's facing:

```logo
forward 100    ; Move forward 100 steps
fd 50          ; Short form - move forward 50 steps
```

The number after the command is the **distance** in steps. Bigger numbers = longer lines.

## Backward Movement

The `back` command (or `bk`) moves the turtle backward without turning around:

```logo
back 100       ; Move backward 100 steps
bk 50          ; Short form
```

The turtle still faces the same direction - it just walks backward.

## Understanding Steps

Steps are screen units (pixels). Some reference points:

| Steps | Approximate Size |
|-------|------------------|
| 10 | Very small |
| 50 | Small |
| 100 | Medium |
| 200 | Large |
| 400 | Very large |

## Combining Movements

You can chain commands together:

```logo
forward 100
back 50
forward 100
back 50
```

This creates a dashed line effect!

## Try It

1. Draw a line 150 steps long
2. Move back to the starting point
3. Draw a series of dashes: forward 20, back 20, forward 20...
