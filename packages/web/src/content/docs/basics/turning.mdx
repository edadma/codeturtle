## Right Turns

The `right` command (or `rt`) rotates the turtle clockwise:

```logo
right 90       ; Turn right 90 degrees
rt 45          ; Short form - turn right 45 degrees
```

## Left Turns

The `left` command (or `lt`) rotates the turtle counter-clockwise:

```logo
left 90        ; Turn left 90 degrees
lt 45          ; Short form
```

## Understanding Angles

Angles are measured in degrees. A full circle is 360 degrees:

| Degrees | Turn Amount |
|---------|-------------|
| 45 | Eighth turn |
| 60 | Sixth turn |
| 90 | Quarter turn (right angle) |
| 120 | Third turn |
| 180 | Half turn (about face) |
| 360 | Full circle (back to start) |

## Common Angle Uses

Different shapes need different angles:

- **Square**: 90° turns (360 ÷ 4 = 90)
- **Triangle**: 120° turns (360 ÷ 3 = 120)
- **Pentagon**: 72° turns (360 ÷ 5 = 72)
- **Hexagon**: 60° turns (360 ÷ 6 = 60)

## The Pattern

Notice the pattern? For any regular polygon:

```
turn angle = 360 ÷ number of sides
```

## Try It

1. Turn right 90 degrees, then left 90 degrees - where is the turtle facing now?
2. Make the turtle spin in a circle: `right 360`
3. Calculate the turn angle for an octagon (8 sides)
