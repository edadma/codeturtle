## What is Logo?

Logo is a programming language created in 1967 specifically for education. It's famous for **turtle graphics** - you control a virtual "turtle" that holds a pen and moves around the screen, drawing as it goes.

## Meet the Turtle

Imagine a small turtle sitting in the middle of your screen. This turtle:

- **Faces a direction** (starts pointing up)
- **Holds a pen** (starts with pen down, ready to draw)
- **Follows your commands** exactly as you type them

When you tell the turtle to move forward, it walks forward and draws a line. When you tell it to turn, it rotates in place. That's it! From these simple ideas, you can create amazing things.

## Why Logo?

Logo is perfect for learning programming because:

1. **Immediate visual feedback** - You see exactly what your code does
2. **Simple commands** - Start with just `forward` and `right`
3. **Builds real skills** - Loops, functions, and variables work just like other languages
4. **Creative and fun** - Make art, not just text output

## Basic Commands Preview

Here are the four commands you'll learn first:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `forward 100` | Move forward 100 steps |
| `back 50` | Move backward 50 steps |
| `right 90` | Turn right 90 degrees |
| `left 45` | Turn left 45 degrees |
