## Equilateral Triangle

An equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides. The turn angle is 120° (360 ÷ 3):

```logo
repeat 3 [forward 100 right 120]
```

## Why 120 Degrees?

It might seem like the angles should be 60° (since triangle interior angles are 60°). But we're measuring the **exterior** angle - how much the turtle turns at each corner:

```
exterior angle = 180° - interior angle
exterior angle = 180° - 60° = 120°
```

Or simply: 360° ÷ 3 sides = 120°

## Right Triangle

A right triangle has one 90° corner:

```logo
forward 100        ; First leg
right 90
forward 100        ; Second leg
right 135
forward 141        ; Hypotenuse (approximately 100 × √2)
```

## Triangle Patterns

### Spinning Triangles

```logo
repeat 12 [
  repeat 3 [forward 100 right 120]
  right 30
]
```

### Triangle Spiral

```logo
make "size 10
repeat 20 [
  repeat 3 [forward :size right 120]
  make "size :size + 10
]
```

### Sierpinski Start

A simple approximation of the Sierpinski triangle:

```logo
repeat 3 [
  repeat 3 [forward 100 right 120]
  penup
  forward 100
  pendown
  right 120
]
```

## Try It

1. Draw a triangle pointing down instead of up
2. Create a Star of David (two overlapping triangles)
3. Make a row of connected triangles (like mountains)
