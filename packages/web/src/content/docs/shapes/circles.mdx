## The Circle Trick

There's no "circle" command in Logo. Instead, we fake it using many tiny steps and turns:

```logo
repeat 360 [forward 1 right 1]
```

This draws a 360-sided polygon - which looks like a circle!

## How It Works

- Move forward a tiny bit
- Turn a tiny bit
- Repeat 360 times (once for each degree)

The turtle traces out a smooth curve.

## Bigger Circles

For larger circles, increase the step size:

```logo
repeat 360 [forward 2 right 1]    ; Bigger circle
repeat 360 [forward 0.5 right 1]  ; Smaller circle
```

## Faster Circles

Drawing 360 steps is slow. Use fewer steps with larger turns:

```logo
repeat 36 [forward 10 right 10]   ; 36-sided polygon, looks circular
repeat 72 [forward 5 right 5]     ; Smoother
```

## Arcs

To draw part of a circle, reduce the repeat count:

```logo
repeat 90 [forward 2 right 1]     ; Quarter circle (90°)
repeat 180 [forward 2 right 1]    ; Semi-circle (180°)
repeat 270 [forward 2 right 1]    ; Three-quarter circle
```

## Semicircle

A useful building block:

```logo
repeat 180 [forward 1 right 1]
```

## Concentric Circles

Draw circles inside circles:

```logo
repeat 360 [forward 1 right 1]
penup
home
left 90
forward 50
right 90
pendown
repeat 360 [forward 0.7 right 1]
```

## Circle Pattern

```logo
repeat 36 [
  repeat 360 [forward 0.5 right 1]
  right 10
]
```

## Try It

1. Draw a smiley face (circle with two small circles for eyes, arc for mouth)
2. Create a target (concentric circles)
3. Draw a flower using arcs
