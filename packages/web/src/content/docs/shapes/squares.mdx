## The Simple Square

A square has 4 equal sides and 4 right angles (90°):

```logo
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90
forward 100
right 90
```

## Using Repeat

Since we do the same thing 4 times, use `repeat`:

```logo
repeat 4 [forward 100 right 90]
```

Much cleaner! The turtle moves forward, turns right, and repeats 4 times.

## Different Sizes

Change the number to make different sized squares:

```logo
repeat 4 [forward 50 right 90]   ; Small square
repeat 4 [forward 100 right 90]  ; Medium square
repeat 4 [forward 200 right 90]  ; Large square
```

## Nested Squares

Draw squares inside squares:

```logo
repeat 4 [forward 100 right 90]
penup
forward 20
right 90
forward 20
left 90
pendown
repeat 4 [forward 60 right 90]
```

## Rotated Squares

Draw the same square multiple times with small rotations:

```logo
repeat 36 [
  repeat 4 [forward 100 right 90]
  right 10
]
```

This creates a beautiful circular pattern of overlapping squares!

## Rectangles

Rectangles have different widths and heights:

```logo
repeat 2 [
  forward 150    ; Long side
  right 90
  forward 75     ; Short side
  right 90
]
```

## Try It

1. Draw 5 squares in a row, each larger than the last
2. Create a square spiral (squares rotating and growing)
3. Make a checkerboard pattern (8x8 squares, alternating filled/empty)
