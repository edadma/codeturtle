## What is a Variable?

A variable is a named container that holds a value. You can change this value and use it in your code.

## Creating Variables

Use `make` to create a variable:

```logo
make "size 100
```

This creates a variable named `size` with value `100`.

## Using Variables

Put a colon before the name to get its value:

```logo
make "size 100
forward :size          ; Moves forward 100
```

## Why the Different Symbols?

- `"size` - The **name** of the variable (with quote)
- `:size` - The **value** of the variable (with colon)

Think of it as:
- Quote = "This is the word 'size'"
- Colon = "Give me what's inside 'size'"

## Changing Variables

Update a variable's value:

```logo
make "size 50
forward :size          ; 50

make "size 100
forward :size          ; 100

make "size :size + 50  ; Add 50 to current value
forward :size          ; 150
```

## Growing Spiral

Variables are perfect for patterns that change:

```logo
make "size 10
repeat 50 [
  forward :size
  right 90
  make "size :size + 5
]
```

Each side gets 5 units longer!

## Color Cycling

```logo
make "colors [red orange yellow green blue purple]
make "i 1
repeat 6 [
  setpencolor item :i :colors
  forward 100
  right 60
  make "i :i + 1
]
```

## Local vs Global Variables

Inside procedures, use `localmake` for local variables:

```logo
to spiral :turns
  localmake "size 5
  repeat :turns [
    forward :size
    right 15
    localmake "size :size + 3
  ]
end
```

Local variables only exist inside the procedure.

## Calculations

Variables can hold calculated values:

```logo
make "side 100
make "angle 360 / 5           ; 72
make "halfside :side / 2      ; 50

repeat 5 [forward :side right :angle]
```

## Try It

1. Create a spiral where the turn angle increases each step
2. Make a "growing squares" pattern using a size variable
3. Draw a rainbow using a color list and index variable
