## Meet Your Turtle

See that little turtle in the middle of the canvas? That's your **turtle**!

The turtle holds a pen and follows your commands. When you tell it to move, it draws a line behind it.

Try typing `fd 100` in the terminal below and press Enter:

<SandboxWrapper canvasSize={300} client:only="react" />

The turtle walked forward 100 steps and drew a line!

## Turn Around

Now try making the turtle turn. Type `rt 90` and press Enter.

The turtle rotated 90 degrees to the right. It's now facing a different direction!

Type `fd 100` again - see how it draws in the new direction?

## Draw a Square

Keep going! Type these commands one at a time:

```
rt 90
fd 100
rt 90
fd 100
```

You just drew a square! The turtle moved forward, turned, moved forward, turned... four times total.

## Quick Commands

Here are the shortcuts you'll use most:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `fd 100` | Move **f**orwar**d** 100 steps |
| `bk 50` | Move **b**ac**k** 50 steps |
| `rt 90` | Turn **r**igh**t** 90 degrees |
| `lt 90` | Turn **l**ef**t** 90 degrees |
| `cs` | **C**lear **s**creen (start over) |

## Try It!

Experiment in the sandbox above. Here are some ideas:

- Draw a bigger square (use `fd 150` instead of `fd 100`)
- Draw a triangle (hint: use `rt 120` for the turns)
- Make the turtle go backwards with `bk`
- Clear and start fresh with `cs`

## What's Next?

You've learned how to move and turn the turtle. Ready to learn a trick that makes drawing shapes much easier?
